## Note: Our project uses Xcode, so we recommend only testing it on a Mac or any other iOS supported device.

# How to install
1. Make sure you have git bash installed so that you may clone the repo: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Clone our repository from GitHub.
3. Install the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12

# How to run
1. Open Xcode
2. Click on "File" on the Mac menu bar and click "Open". You may also click "Open a project or file" from the Xcode GUI.
3. Navigate to the directory "FridgeBud" from our repository and click open.
4. Press Command-R to open a simulated iOS device running our app.
5. If the FridgeBud app does not open directly in the Simulator, try pressing the home button on the iPhone and opening it from the home screen.
